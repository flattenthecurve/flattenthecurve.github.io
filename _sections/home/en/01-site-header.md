## Science & Teamwork
On March 12, 2020, scientists and health experts from around the world collaborated to provide the most up-to-date information about how to beat COVID-19. In that first week, we reached 1.2 million people. By now virtually everyone has heard the word but we're still here to keep urging people to find sustainable ways to reduce the community spread as much as they can. An archive of the content is available at https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide
