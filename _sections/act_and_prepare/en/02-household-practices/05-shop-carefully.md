### Shopping carefully

If you can afford to have groceries delivered, or can have someone shop for you, do so. Else, if you are elderly or immunocompromised go to the store first thing in the morning when things are less touched.

Some stores are extending their hours or dedicating special hour(s) for these vulnerable populations, more info [here](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1239244137834127362).
