### Keep your home clean and disinfect

Surface contamination while possible has not been shown to be the main mechanism of infection. That said, in laboratory environments, [research](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf) the virus has been shown to survive on surfaces. Therefore if you're at high risk or work in a high-risk environment, is still a good idea to have a 'staging' area for clean entry into your home. Remove shoes, outerwear. Isolate your mail, packages and purchases at least a few hours, especially if you don't need them right away.
