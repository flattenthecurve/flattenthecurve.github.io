### Stay home

The United States is a big country, with 50 states, each handling this in a different way. Therefore, community spread
is going to be occurring at different rates in different places. The best thing to do, if not required by your employer, is to stay home until this curve has sufficiently flattened.

-   Do not dine out.
-   Do not go to the movies - listen to the radio, watch TV, listen to podcasts, do puzzles, play board games, create an in-home disco.
-   Do not go to church - use home rituals or streaming services.
-   Do not go to work unless you must, and when you return have a routine for coming back so as not to bring the virus into your home.
-   Do not go shopping for non-essentials.
-   If you get restaurant food delivered, use a service that you can prepay and have the delivery person leave the food on the doorstep. Order well before you want to eat so you can isolate the food for a few hours, then heat it up if needed.
-   When you go grocery shopping, wear gloves and isolate your purchases (and your gloves!) in a safe spot for a few hours before unpacking.
-   Get outside! But keep walking. Say hi to people, get some social interaction, but get it in passing. Keep physical
    distance from others. Don't stop and form groups. Make sure and wave to all the pets being walked.
