### Stay home

The world is a big place; expect different regions and different individuals to handle risks differently. The most effective intervention is to limit crowds and physical proximity with other people. If your local officials recommend staying home, do this as much as possible. If restrictions in your area have been lifted, it doesn't mean that everything is back to normal. It means that there is hopefully ICU capacity to accommodate you if you need it. Alternatively, if your local restrictions have been lifted it could reflect popular demand, rather than ICU capacity per se.

Taken together, making safer sustainable everyday choices on average -- not just this week but for the next several months -- can flatten the curve. Continue to support your local economy, but go off peak; waiting for even 15 minutes can reduce both crowding and contact. Everything from restaurants to museums to public transport will be less risky (and more pleasant!) off peak.

There are no bright lines of risk. Risks and their mitigations are varied and incompletely understood. So aim to lower risk and to make them count. 

Lowest risk | Intermediate risk | Highest risk
-----|----|----
Home | Small gatherings | Large gatherings
Outdoors * | Well ventilated indoors ** | Poorly ventilated indoors
Average households | Stores | Care homes, prisons, meat packing facilities, hospitals
Distanced encounter | Close encounter | Intimate encounter
Shorter exposure time | Moderate exposure time | Longer exposure time
Two people each wearing a face covering | Two people, one wearing a face covering | Two people, neither wearing a face covering
Encounter where local transmission is low | Encounter where local transmission is moderate | Encounter where local transmission is high

Note that any of these above risks are higher where the mixing of the contact pools are also higher.

'* Note that even when outside the more intense the sunlight, the safer the encounter. Humidity levels may not play an especially strong role.

Avoiding large public gatherings is going to put a massive economic burden on musicians, actors, artists, and anyone else who puts on or helps stage live appearances. Consider supporting their work on Patreon or directly (via PayPal/Venmo/GoFundMe), promoting them on social media, and buying their work directly. Attend smaller shows if they offer them.
