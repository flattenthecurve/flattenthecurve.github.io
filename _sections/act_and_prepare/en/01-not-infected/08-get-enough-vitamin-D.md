### Get enough vitamin D

[There](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5692194/) [is](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ped.2017.0750?journalCode=ped) [sufficient](https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamind_pneumonia_children/en/) [evidence](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011597.pub2/full) to conclude that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of respiratory infections in general.
In addition, a [retrospective cohort study in the journal _Infectious Diseases_](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770157), concluded that "deficient vitamin D status was associated with increased COVID-19 risk".
Unfortunately, a sizable fraction (perhaps 41.6% according to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306) study) of Americans are deficient.
Fortunately though, according to a [randomized study in _The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764), "administration of calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D to hospitalized COVID-19 patients significantly reduced their need for Intensive Care United admission" and "seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease".
The two main ways to ensure you are getting enough of this essential vitamin are to (1) get enough sunlight and (2) take vitamin D supplements.
[Some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158535000133) suggests darker-skinned people may need significantly more sun exposure to get adequate vitamin D.
The US Institute of Medicine suggests taking 400â€“800 IU of vitamin D daily, but [many experts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698592/) think 1,000 IU or more is needed if you don't have regular sun exposure.
