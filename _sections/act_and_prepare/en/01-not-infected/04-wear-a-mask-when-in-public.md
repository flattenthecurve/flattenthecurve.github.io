### Wear a facemask when in public

The US Center for Disease Control ["recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html).
According to the World Health Organization's top emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, ["using respiratory coverings or mouth coverings to prevent coughing and sneezing projecting disease into the environment and towards others...is not a bad idea"](https://youtu.be/eh5hTTRd2Zs?t=3560).
In addition, there are at least [“34 scientific papers indicating basic masks can be effective in reducing virus transmission in public”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/28/masks-all-coronavirus/).
As a result, many countries have started making mask-wearing (including scarves and bandanas) mandatory in public areas, such as the [Czech Republic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/czechs-get-to-work-making-masks-after-government-decree-coronavirus), [Slovakia](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/01/825180019/in-big-adjustment-some-european-countries-push-for-residents-to-wear-masks), [Vietnam](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/vietnam-imposes-hefty-fines-going-maskless), [Austria](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52143873), [Israel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-israel/israelis-told-to-wear-face-masks-in-public-mark-religious-holidays-with-close-family-only-idUSKBN21J6KZ), and some American cities such as [New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-face-masks-andrew-cuomo.html) and [Los Angeles](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-08/coronavirus-los-angeles-mandatory-face-covering-rules).
[N95 and surgical masks](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks) are the most effective, but homemade masks are still beneficial. Consider donating any N95s to local healthcare workers if there is a shortage in your area and making homemade masks for your own household.
