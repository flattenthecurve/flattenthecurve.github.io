### Wear a facemask when in public

Studies have shown for Influenza that a mask may have a self-protection benefit. The viron that causes COVID-19 is roughly the same size as the Influenza viron at 125 nanometers and it has the same mechanisms of entering the human body. If you absolutely have to venture into public where other people may be, buy a cloth mask or make your own as US hospital chains are beginning to do.
