Vitamin D deficiency is highly correlated with respiratory infections in general and probably COVID-19 in particular.

According to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306) study, 41.6% of Americans are deficient.
The two main ways to ensure you are getting enough of this essential vitamin are to (1) get enough sunlight and (2) take vitamin D supplements.
[Some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158535000133) suggests darker-skinned people may need significantly more sun exposure to get adequate vitamin D.
The US Institute of Medicine suggests taking 400â€“800 IU of vitamin D daily, but [many experts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698592/) think 1,000 IU or more is needed if you don't have regular sun exposure.
