## Stay vigilant; a vaccine is on the way

Although a significant fraction of the world has already been infected with Coronavirus, vigilance is still warranted. This is especially true now that safe and highly effective vaccines are on the horizon. In the US, rollout to healthcare workers will begin as soon as December, 2020 and to vulnerable populations thereafter. It is estimated that the vaccine would be widely available by summer 2020.
