## This is not a normal flu
**Not even in the best case**

In pandemics, it can take years to determine the infection fatality rate. This is normal. Most experts now estimate the range to be between [.5% and 1%](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1267311325765500930). However, keep in mind that even 1% would be ten fold higher than a typical seasonal influenza year. Moreover, mortality is not the full picture. Coronavirus can [affect multiple organs](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30558-4/fulltext). Even for those who recover, there could be longer-term implications that are not yet well understood.
