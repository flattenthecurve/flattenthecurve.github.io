## Certain policies are more effective for pandemic control

-   Universal healthcare coverage.
-   Universal guaranteed [paid sick leave](https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/policies/for-how-long-are-workers-guaranteed-paid-sick-leave).
-   Paid sick leave duration of 4-6 weeks.
-   Guaranteed paid family leave (to care for sick members).
-   Coordinated financial or operational support for people who should self-quarantine.
-   Policies that incentivize insurers to provide rather than withhold care.
-   Policies that separate health care from employment. (Otherwise when people get sick they are also vulnerable to bankruptcy, or when unemployed lose healthcare. In a pandemic year both are devastating.)
-   [Clear, truthful, and transparent public messaging](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/) at all levels about the seriousness of the threat and what ordinary people can do to help.

The fact that such policies have not previously existed in some countries complicates the behaviors required to #flattenthecurve.
