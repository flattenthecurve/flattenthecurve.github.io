## No country is fully prepared, including the United States

Although the [WHO's JEE report from 2016](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254701/WHO-WHE-CPI-2017.13-eng.pdf) rates the US highly in preparedness for a public health emergency, a [Johns Hopkins University study](https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/pandemic-influenza-and-major-disease-outbreak-preparedness-in-us--7) noted that "there appear to be significant gaps in pandemic influenza and other infectious disease outbreak planning among the hospitals".
According to the [IHME's projections from April 1st](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/Estimation_update_040120.pdf), "the US is predicted to need 262,092 total hospital beds (39,727 for ICU), and 31,782 ventilators to support COVD-19 patients. This demand on hospital resources could lead to a nationwide shortage of 87,674 total hospital beds and 19,863 ICU beds given current COVID-19 trajectories."
We simply don't have the equipment, training, or messaging in place and we need to ramp up fast.
No one does.
That is why your choices today matter so much.
