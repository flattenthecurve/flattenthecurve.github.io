  "about": "As we learn more about COVID-19, a simple graph has gone viral: ‚ÄúFlatten the Curve.‚Äù Praised for shedding light on the scale and speed of the outbreak, it illustrates the wave of expected COVID-19 cases.\n\n- A high curve means the virus is spreading quickly; some people won‚Äôt get the medical care they need, and the number of deaths is likely to increase.\n- A flattened curve means COVID-19 is spreading slowly, staggering the rate of people with COVID-19 and giving doctors time to best utilize scarce resources to treat people and save lives. \n\n## Purpose\nWe can all slow the spread of COVID-19 and ‚ÄúFlatten the Curve‚Äù together. This site provides reliable information reviewed by scientists delivered in as many languages as possible to help:\n1. Understand when and how to protect ourselves;\n2. Understand how to self-isolate, quarantine, and help others stay healthy;\n3. Increase our knowledge about COVID-19 and related trends; \n4. Avoid panic and trauma by providing everyone with the right information, when we need it, and in our own language;\n5. Provide access to resources to expedite research and collaboration, such as information to participate in clinical trials.\n\nFlatten the Curve is a collective effort of people, including scientists and health experts. We are not speaking on behalf of organizations or trying to duplicate official communication channels.\n\n\n## Authors\n\nContent initially compiled by Julie McMurry, masters degree in public health from the [University of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://lshtm.ac.uk/) as well as a background in infectious diseases and vaccine development.
