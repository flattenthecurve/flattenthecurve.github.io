## Look beyond yourself

At all times, be kind to each other and be mindful of other people's worries. [You may be in a low risk group and feel this is nothing to
fret about, but your 80-year old neighbor or your friend with recent heart surgery may feel quite differently.](https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1235318985429782532) Every person matters; no one is "expendable."

**Mutual Aid Resources:**

Looking for ways to support your neighbors and community, especially those who are most vulnerable? There are many places online compiling links to mutual aid resources for different cities/regions. For example:

* [US COVID-19 Mutual Aid Resources (Google folders by state)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dKDM8CA32gZ1L2v_MFewohqJhVnCsi71?usp=sharing)

[With all the cancellations this is one of the first times we've seen normalization of an "it's everybody's problem approach." Yes, your one cancelled event might not save lives but the fact that everyone is doing this will. Same mentality is needed for climate change.](https://twitter.com/JasonWilliamsNY/status/1236332192172838912) Because travel is a big source of the spread, use the occasion to buy locally grown produce. This will reduce coronavirus transmission, support your local economy, and also have a net carbon savings.
