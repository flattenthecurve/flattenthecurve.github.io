AARP's new Community Connections website helps people find local mutual aid groups. Across the country, people are organizing online mutual aid groups to stay connected, share ideas, and help those in need.  Whether you want to start a group, find a group, or even request a friendly call from one of our volunteers, we can help you connect with people in your community.
