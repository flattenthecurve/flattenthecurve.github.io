MakerMask is a source for science-based mask designs for community makers to combat the spread of COVID-19. It is important that we use the best information possible to help protect ourselves and our communities. The MakerMask designs use latex-free, water-resistant materials that are likely to provide improved protection over cotton and elastic.  We need makers/sewists/helpers of all abilities to begin ramping up production to meet community needs.
