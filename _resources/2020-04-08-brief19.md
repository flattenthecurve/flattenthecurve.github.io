Brief19 is a daily roundup of covid-19 research and policy, curated, written, and edited by medical and science experts working on the frontlines. It was created to help other frontline doctors, who are especially time-deficient, stay up to date on relevant news without having to sift through numerous resources. We're primarily Twitter-based but the website continues to evolve.
