We invite you to join a global project to create fabric masks that promote hope, humanity, and hygiene practices in time of crisis. Collaborating across borders, we want to raise awareness about the risks of COVID-19 infection and the need for physical distancing and self-isolation, while advocating solidarity with the most vulnerable in our global community.
